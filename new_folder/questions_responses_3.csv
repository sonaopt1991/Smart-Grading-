Question,Response
Explain the difference between lists and tuples in Python.,"Lists are dynamic and can be altered after creation, whereas tuples remain constant once defined. Lists use [], while tuples use (). Tuples are generally faster than lists."
Describe the role of indentation in Python.,"Python enforces indentation to define code blocks, ensuring structure and readability. Unlike languages that use curly braces, Python relies solely on indentation."
What are Python's built-in data types?,"Python has various built-in types: int, float, complex for numbers; list, tuple, range for sequences; str for text; set, frozenset for sets; dict for mappings; and bool for booleans."
Explain how Python handles memory management.,Python manages memory using automatic garbage collection and reference counting. It ensures unused objects are removed to free up memory.
"What are Python decorators, and how are they used?",A decorator is a function that modifies another function's behavior without altering its definition. It is applied using the @ symbol.
What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy in Python?,"Shallow copies copy an object but not its nested elements, whereas deep copies create a completely independent duplicate, including all nested objects."
What are Python modules and packages?,"A module is a Python script with reusable code, while a package is a collection of modules in a directory containing an __init__.py file."
Explain the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.,"The GIL allows only one thread to execute at a time in Python, restricting true multi-threading but enabling multi-processing as an alternative."
How does exception handling work in Python?,"Python uses try-except blocks for error handling. The try block contains the risky code, and the except block defines how to handle exceptions."
What is the purpose of the `__init__` method in Python classes?,The __init__ method initializes an instanceâ€™s attributes when an object is created from a class.
How do you create a virtual environment in Python?,"Run `python -m venv env_name` to create a virtual environment, isolating project dependencies."
